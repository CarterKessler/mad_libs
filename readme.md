# Mad Libs!

[Madlibs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) are great!

1. Use the the `index.html` as starter code. In it are just some paragraph tags with some span elements inside.

2. Allow for users to input words in text field(s)

3. After all words are entered for the mad lib, Create a click event that renders a view that fills the words in the textfields into the placeholders within the madlib.

## notes
- You can change the html however you want!
- you'll need to create one or more input tags
- there are LOTS of ways to execute this code

## Bonus
- Use only one input tag.
- Create other madlib templates.
