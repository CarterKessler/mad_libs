# Mad Libs!

[Madlibs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) are great!

1. Use the the `index.html` as starter code. In it are just some paragraph tags with some span elements inside.

2. Create a `script.js` that will contain your javascript

3. Allow for users to input words in text field(s)

4. After all words are entered for the mad lib, Create a click event that renders a view that fills the words in the textfields into the placeholders within the madlib.

## Hints
- You can change the html however you want!
- you'll need to create one or more input tags

## Bonus
Use only one input tag.
Create other madlib templates.
